# Program to change the items of a created list in Python

#First create a list and print its contents
mylist = ["HP", "Dell", "Lenovo", "Apple", "Asus"]
print (mylist)

#Now lets change "Apple" to "Acer"
mylist [3] = "Acer"
#Note, here 0 means 1, 1 means 2 and so on. That's why 3 is the 
#4th value of the list

print (mylist)
#This will print the new list with changed item
